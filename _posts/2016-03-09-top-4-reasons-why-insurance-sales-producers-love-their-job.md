# Top 4 Reasons Why Insurance Sales Producers Love their Job...

## ...and why it might matter to you.

The career of a commercial insurance producer (agent/broker) is a challenging, competitive, and rewarding life. Even with the flexibility, independence, and high income potential, most producers ended up in the insurance business by happenstance. How we got here may vary greatly, but why many of us stayed are similar.

According to a recent survey of insurance producers conducted by[The National Alliance Research Academy][0], more than 50% of the producers stated the following 4 reasons as why they remained in insurance sales:

1. _**Helping People with Insurance Needs**_(72%) - Commercial insurance is not a churn-n-burn, hard close sale. Insurance agents/brokers are professional advisers helping business owners make the best decisions to protect their business.
2. **_People Contact_**(69%) - Insurance producers develop strong relationships with their business clients. 
3. **_Earning a High Income_**(57%) - According to [MyCareerAdvancement.com][1], an experience commercial lines producer can earn well over $100,000 (even in the Southern Indiana market). The best part is the residual income insurance renewals can provide.
4. **_Change and Constant Learning_**(51%) - Commercial insurance is challenging. There is no cookie-cutter answer for your commercial clients. To be great in this business, you must invest part of your time every year in education. 

If you are a _competitive, driven individual _who is interested in a **professional, consultative B2B sales position**, contact me via this website. Our insurance agency is searching for the right candidate to invest our time and resources into. No insurance experience necessary. Our new Producer will participate in an industry leading yearlong sales development and coaching program. I look forward to hearing from you.
